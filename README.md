 Hybrid File System (March 2025 – April 2025)
This project simulates a custom file system designed to demonstrate core concepts of OS-level file management. It includes logic for file operations such as creation, deletion, reading, and metadata tracking using a JSON-based structure.

Features
Custom file system simulation in Python

File creation, deletion, and metadata tracking

JSON-based metadata structure

Command-line interface for interaction

Google Drive integration for cloud backup

Technologies Used
Python

JSON

Google Drive API

Operating System file management concepts

Objective
The aim was to understand and demonstrate how operating systems manage files internally—handling memory, metadata, and storage logic—through a simplified simulation.

Note
This project does not implement FAT or inode-based systems directly, but uses simplified logic inspired by those principles to simulate file handling
